Note:
-	A step wise guide for installing anaconda navigator and tensorflow can be found in this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#windows-native_1).
-	The links specified are subject to update.
-	The python notebook was executed with the software/packages with specification mentioned above. When the files are executed in another setup, a slight difference in the accuracy values is expected.
-	The execution time differs based on the hardware setup used. The current outputs in the python notebook were executed with a batch size of 16 and with GPUs RTX 3060 and 3090.
